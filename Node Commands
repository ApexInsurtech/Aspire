
Initiate Proposal:
-------------------
flow start ProposalFlow$Initiator isBuyer: true, amount: 10, counterparty: PartyB

View Proposal in Vault:
------------------------

run vaultQuery contractStateType: negotiation.contracts.ProposalState

NOTE: Copy the linearId.id from the response, we will use this to modify the proposal state.

Modify Proposal:
----------------

If we note down the state's linearId.id, we can now modify the proposal from the shell of PartyB by running:

flow start ModificationFlow$Initiator proposalId: 7b90d0a9-ca68-4b5b-84ff-f6281d247868, newAmount: 8

This flow can be only be executed by the party receiving the proposal state.

Acceptance Proposal:
---------------------

Finally, let's have PartyA accept the proposal:

flow start AcceptanceFlow$Initiator proposalId: 7b90d0a9-ca68-4b5b-84ff-f6281d247868

View Acceptance/Trade Proposal:
-------------------------------

Once the acceptance flow has been successfully executed the Proposal State is transformed into a Trade State.  We can now see the accepted trade in our vault with the new value by running the command (note we are now querying for TradeStates, not ProposalStates):

run vaultQuery contractStateType: negotiation.contracts.TradeState
